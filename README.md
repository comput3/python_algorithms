# python_algo
have fun and explore the data dimensions of various algorithms
* volume - the expected size of the data that the algorithm will process
* velocity - the rate of new data generation when the algorithm is used, it can be zero
* variety - the variety quantifies how many different types of data the designed algorithm will process
