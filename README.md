# python_algo
have fun and explore the data dimensions of various algorithms
* volume - the expected size of the data that the algorithm will process
* velocity - the rate of new data generation when the algorithm is used, it can be zero
* variety - the variety quantifies how many different types of data the designed algorithm will process

### performance estimation

### Big O
#### Logarithmic Time O(logn)
The algorithm execution time is proportional to the logarithm og the input size.
#### Constant Time O(1)
The algorithm execution time is the same regardless of the size of the input. 
#### Linear Time O(n)
The algorithm execution time is directly proportional to the size of the input.
#### Quadradic Time O(n**2)
The algorithm execution time is proportional to the square (or worse) of the size of the input.
